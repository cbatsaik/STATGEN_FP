    "text": "In statistics, a collider is a variable that is causally associated with predictors X and Y.

Berkson demonstrated how two diseases that are unrelated in the general population, like gallbladder inflammation and diabetes, can become spuriously associated when a sample is restricted to individuals in a hospital, because a patient who does not have gallbladder inflammation was much more likely to have another disease like diabetes than someone from the general population.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Weak Instrument Bias occurs when Instrumental Variables (IVs) are only weakly associated with the collider variable. This bias causes Type 1 Error since the IVs don’t explain sufficient amounts of variation in the collider variable.\nMethods that use IV’s are prone to this bias, especially Mendelian Randomization, Instrument Effect Regression, and Slope-Hunter Method. The Corrected Weighted Least Squares Method of collider correction uses IV’s, but it corrects for their confounding so it does not experience this bias as strongly as some other methods.\nWhen choosing a model, it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages that each model brings to maximize efficiency and truth in your results."

In order to do this, Slope-Hunter uses GWAS results to plot the estimates of exposure association with collider on the x-axis and the outcome conditional on collider on the y-axis. Then, the clustering algorithm identifies exposures that affect the collider variable and selects these as helpful Instrumental Variables. These new IV’s are used to produce a new slope that has adjusted for the effect of the Collider Variables.\nThis model assumes that its model based clustering algorithm has correctly identified the instrumental variables. If these IV’s were identified incorrectly, and the new correction is based on exposures that have no affect on the collider, then the bias still exists and the results are inaccurate."

This method is implemented through an equation that models the conditional effect of the exposure on the outcome given the collider as a constant.\nInstructions for correction:\n\nInstall ColliderBias package by Siyang Cai and load library.\nUse methodCB() function to assign the arguments to your GWAS output data.\nSpecified the method in methodCB() to “CWLS” for the type of correction we are using.\nInterpret the output values! The most important for CWLS are b and b_cor:\n\nb: The coefficient of the regression (slope) of ybeta[prune] on xbeta[prune], after correction for regression dilution.\nb_cor: The adjusted slope that compares the biased slope to the corrected slope.\n\n\nCWLS may not be the best correction method because produces results with residual heteroskedasticity. Other methods like Mendelian Randomization are more effective when accounting for variance in the b coefficient. Results from CWLS can be compared to MR through the MR-Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR-RAPS).\nThere also exists a Corrected Weighted Bivariate Least Squares (CWBLS) method that serves the purpose of identifying the magnitude of collider bias that exists in a model. It uses a bivariate formula to analyze the summary statistics of each exposure in relation to the collider and the outcome.\nTo implement this, run the CWBLS() function from the ColliderBias package on your data. It will produce the b value that reflects the true causal association between exposure and collider. This method will also produce b.se which represents the standard error of b. To interpret the standard error, previous work recommends using bootstrapping."

In contrast, 2SLS works directly with individual-level genotype and phenotype data like our simulated data.\nMethods like MR-Egger are built to detect and correct for pleiotropy, which is when SNPs affect the outcome through other pathways besides the exposure, but in our simulation, we intentionally designed the SNPs to influence only height, not sex directly, so there’s no pleiotropy to correct."

This is exactly the kind of bias introduced when you condition on a collider. It opens up a causal path between SNPs and sex, even though there’s no true genetic link there.\nThis QQ plot shows that when happened when we used MR to correct for height in the relationship between SNPs and sex. \nAs you can see, the points aren’t perfect but they fall much closer to the red line than they did without correction. This means the observed p-values are much closer to what we’d expect under the null, and using MR helped us minimize the inflated test statistics we were seeing before!\nResults of our Study: Mendelian randomization helped eliminate much of the bias introduced by our collider variable height when modeling binary sex as an outcome of SNPs."
