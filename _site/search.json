Someone can be genetically more likely to have that trait, hence the arrow from X (genetics) to the Collider. But depression and anxiety can also be caused by non-genetic factors, like stressful living conditions or exposure to trauma, which would be Y. But Genes do not cause stressful living conditions or exposure to trauma, which makes depression or anxiety a collider, since the other 2 variables have arrows that collide on it. \nMany genetic variants and phenotypes both influence other traits- like height, BMI, or disease diagnosis, but those same traits may have another cause unrelated to genes. This is what makes the possibility of having collider bias so prevalent in genetic studies. Because of this, we wanted to explore correction methods for how to adjust for a collider that has been included in a Genome Wide Association Study."

In order to do this, Slope-Hunter uses GWAS results to plot the estimates of exposure association with collider on the x-axis and the outcome conditional on collider on the y-axis. Then, the clustering algorithm identifies exposures that affect the collider variable and selects these as helpful Instrumental Variables. These new IV’s are used to produce a new slope that has adjusted for the effect of the Collider Variables.\nThis model assumes that its model based clustering algorithm has correctly identified the instrumental variables. If these IV’s were identified incorrectly, and the new correction is based on exposures that have no affect on the collider, then the bias still exists and the results are inaccurate."

This method is implemented through an equation that models the conditional effect of the exposure on the outcome given the collider as a constant.\nInstructions for correction:\n\nInstall ColliderBias package by Siyang Cai and load library.\nUse methodCB() function to assign the arguments to your GWAS output data.\nSpecified the method in methodCB() to “CWLS” for the type of correction we are using.\nInterpret the output values! The most important for CWLS are b and b_cor:\n\nb: The coefficient of the regression (slope) of ybeta[prune] on xbeta[prune], after correction for regression dilution.\nb_cor: The adjusted slope that compares the biased slope to the corrected slope.\n\n\nCWLS may not be the best correction method because produces results with residual heteroskedasticity. Other methods like Mendelian Randomization are more effective when accounting for variance in the b coefficient. Results from CWLS can be compared to MR through the MR-Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR-RAPS).\nThere also exists a Corrected Weighted Bivariate Least Squares (CWBLS) method that serves the purpose of identifying the magnitude of collider bias that exists in a model. It uses a bivariate formula to analyze the summary statistics of each exposure in relation to the collider and the outcome.\nTo implement this, run the CWBLS() function from the ColliderBias package on your data. It will produce the b value that reflects the true causal association between exposure and collider. This method will also produce b.se which represents the standard error of b. To interpret the standard error, previous work recommends using bootstrapping."

The Corrected Weighted Least Squares Method of collider correction uses IV’s, but it corrects for their confounding so it does not experience this bias as strongly as some other methods.\nWhen choosing a model, it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages that each model brings to maximize efficiency and truth in your results."
