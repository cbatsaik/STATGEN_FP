To work properly, an IV must do three things:\n\nPredict the exposure: our IVs (the five SNPs) each have a real, measurable effect on height in our data.\nAffect the outcome only through that exposure: in our simulation, each SNP influences the probability of “Sex = 1” only because it shifts height; there is no other built-in pathway from these genetic variants to the sex outcome.\nBe independent of confounders: we generated sex and all other noise completely at random, so our SNPs can’t be tangled up with any hidden factors that might otherwise bias the height-sex relationship.\n\nIn our project, we discovered that simply regressing sex on measured height creates a false association. MR fixes this by isolating the genetic component of height and that strips away all the collider-induced noise."

The main difference is that accounting for confounders and mediators helps address bias, but accounting for a collider can cause bias."

Someone can be genetically more likely to have that trait, hence the arrow from X (genetics) to the Collider. But depression and anxiety can also be caused by non-genetic factors, like stressful living conditions or exposure to trauma, which would be Y. But Genes do not cause stressful living conditions or exposure to trauma, which makes depression or anxiety a collider, since the other 2 variables have arrows that collide on it. \nMany genetic variants and phenotypes both influence other traits- like height, BMI, or disease diagnosis, but those same traits may have another cause unrelated to genes. This is what makes the possibility of having collider bias so prevalent in genetic studies. Because of this, we wanted to explore correction methods for how to adjust for a collider that has been included in a Genome Wide Association Study."

Then, the clustering algorithm identifies exposures that affect the collider variable and selects these as helpful Instrumental Variables. These new IV’s are used to produce a new slope that has adjusted for the effect of the Collider Variables.\n\nThe Slope-Hunter method assumes that its model based clustering algorithm has correctly identified the instrumental variables. If these IV’s were identified incorrectly, and the new correction is based on exposures that have no affect on the collider, then the bias still exists.\nAn R package called SlopeHunter by Osmahmoud exists to use the Slope-Hunter method for collider bias correction."

The most important for CWLS are b and b_cor:\n\nb: The coefficient of the regression (slope) of ybeta[prune] on xbeta[prune], after correction for regression dilution.\nb_cor: The adjusted slope that compares the biased slope to the corrected slope.\n\n\nCWLS may not be the best correction method because produces results with residual heteroskedasticity. Other methods like Mendelian Randomization are more effective when accounting for variance in the b coefficient. Results from CWLS can be compared to MR through the MR-Robust Adjusted Profile Score (MR-RAPS).\nThere also exists a Corrected Weighted Bivariate Least Squares (CWBLS) method that serves the purpose of identifying the magnitude of collider bias that exists in a model. It uses a bivariate formula to analyze the summary statistics of each exposure in relation to the collider and the outcome.\nTo implement this, run the CWBLS() function from the ColliderBias package on your data.

    "text": "Weak Instrument Bias occurs when Instrumental Variables (IVs) are only weakly associated with the collider variable. This bias causes Type 1 Error since the IVs don’t explain sufficient amounts of variation in the collider variable.\nMethods that use IV’s are prone to this bias, especially Mendelian Randomization, Instrument Effect Regression, and Slope-Hunter Method. The Corrected Weighted Least Squares Method of collider correction uses IV’s, but it corrects for their confounding so it does not experience this bias as strongly as some other methods. When choosing a model, it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages that each model brings to maximize efficiency and truth in your results.\nWeak Instrument Bias is demonstrated in QQ Plots from our Mendelian Randomization Correction example. This first QQ plot shows the relationship between Sex and SNP without including the collider Height.\n\nAs you can see, the points fall along the red line which indicates a nearly perfect Normal Distribution.\nThis second QQ plot shows the relationship between Sex and Height_hat, which is the collider-corrected predictor variable that includes information from both SNP and Height.\n\nIn this QQ plot, the points fall very close to the red line, following a similar slope, yet slightly shifted above the line. This shows that the collider-corrected model does not follow a perfectly Normal Distribution because the Instrumental Variables from the Mendelian Randomization do not perfectly explain the variation in the relationship.\nThis is Weak Instrument Bias, and all collider-corrected models will experience it to some degree. We still encourage statisticians to correct for collider bias in their models, despite Weak Instrument Bias, because it offers a more complete understanding of the relationship being modeled. Being transparent and honest about the limitations and structure of your data and models is essential to producing trustworthy and meaningful statistics."
