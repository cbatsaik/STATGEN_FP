## **What is Collider Bias?**

**A collider is a variable caused by both X and Y**, and including it in a model **leads to bias** because it combines the causal effect of X on Y with the causal effect of X and Y on the collider. 

Colliders are less common than confounding variables and mediator variables, which you may be familiar with. The main difference is that accounting for confounders and mediators helps address bias, but accounting for a collider can **cause** bias.

## Berkson's Bias

How exactly does the inclusion of a collider cause bias? Physician and statistician **Joseph Berkson** helped explain this with a paradoxical example, which is why Collider bias is also known as **Berkson’s bias**. 

He demonstrated how **two diseases that are unrelated in the general population**, like gallbladder inflammation and diabetes, **can become spuriously associated when a sample is restricted to individuals in a hospital,** because a patient who does not have gallbladder inflammation was much more likely to have another disease like diabetes than someone from the general population.

If we looked at the general population, we would not see this association, so **adjusting for the collider variable “hospital” is introducing the bias.**

## How do we Deal With it?

Usually, scientists have **removed** colliders from their models to escape this bias. However, we suggest that scientists implement **collider correction methods** to retain the important predictive information from the collider variable while still producing an unbiased model.

For this project, we walk through an example of how to correct for collider bias in a statistical genetics context using **2-Stage Mendelian Randomization**. We also include information on other relevant correction methods for collider bias and the helpful tools if you choose to implement them.
